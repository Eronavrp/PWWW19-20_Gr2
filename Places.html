                        <h2>HISTORY:</h2>
                        <p>Germia National Park is a park located in the north-east of Kosova's capital city Prishtina. It is a part of the Rhodope Mountains, which
                        connect Kosova and Macedonia. Since 1987 the municipality of Prishtina took it under protection. </p>
                        <h2>What can you do there</h2>
                        <p>Germia National Park is one of the people's favorite place to spend a day off, especially in the summer weekends. This comes as a result of
                            the nature and the air purity there, among several activities that the park provides. Starting from the big space, in which you can organize 
                            picnics, and a variety of games for everyone, no matter the age differences. Moving on to the children's playgrounds, and restaurants for the 
                            parents to relax. Also there are several Volleyball, Basketball and Football fields in which sometimes are organized events. Summer is the 
                            best season to visit this park, because of Germia Swimming Pool. And, last but not least, if you came for experimental purposes (Biology),
                            Germia is the place with the richest fauna in Kosova. As you can see, there is no one that can't enjoy that place. If you won't, then you are 
                            crazy.</p>

                                    picnics, and a variety of games for everyone, no matter the age differences. Moving on to the children's playgrounds, and restaurants for the 
                                    parents to relax. Also there are several Volleyball, Basketball and Football fields in which sometimes are organized events. Summer is the 
                                    best season to visit this park, because of Germia Swimming Pool. And, last but not least, if you came for experimental purposes (Biology),
